    <h1>Running against a Republican in the Deep South?</h1><p><em><strong>Uncontested.</strong></em></p>
    <p>In 2022, <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/democrats-allowed-24-republican-house-candidates-run-unopposed-1760345">Democrats did not even field candidates</a> against 24 Republicans for the U.S. House of Representatives. At the state level, the numbers get even worse. In Alabama, <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2022/02/most-alabama-lawmakers-want-4-more-years-dozens-will-return-unopposed.html">64 incumbents ran unopposed</a>—46 Republicans in the state House and Senate. The lack of competition from Democrats led to a Red Wave in Southern Legislatures <a href="https://www.facingsouth.org/2022/12/red-wave-hits-southern-legislatures">where Republicans gained over 55 seats.</a></p>
    <h2>How can Democratic candidates be competitive in the South in 2024/2026?</h2>
    <p>For Democrats to be competitive in the South, they need to connect directly with voters, address issues that constituents care about, and mobilize communities to make a difference. The cheapest, most effective way to connect directly with voters is through SEO and content strategy.</p>
    <ul><li><strong>Search Engine Optimization ensures voters are introduced to Democratic candidates</strong> when searching for information about issues.</li><li>By improving their ranking on popular search engines, candidates <strong>build authority and trust</strong> with their communities.</li><li>A thoughtful, content-driven website <strong>allows voters to educate themselves</strong> and make informed decisions.</li><li>A strong <strong>SEO and content strategy improves candidate visibility</strong>—-even among voters on the other side of the aisle.</li></ul>
    <h2>SEO and Content Strategy are the best way for grassroots Democratic candidates to be competitive with Republicans online.</h2><p>I'm offering FREE Search Engine Optimization and Content Strategy consultations for Democrats in the Deep South.
