    <h2>I'm launching a book club!</h2>
      <p>After years of putting it off, I finally launched a weekly book club. It's an opportunity for me to talk about books and ideas that matter to me with people who are actively investing in themselves. We've got a private Discord channel, weekly meetings, and ongoing professional support. Things kick off next Thursday with "Linchpin" by Seth Godin. Want in? Send me an <a href="form">email</a>.</p>
    <h2>I'm taking the Summer off from classes at Troy.</h2>
        <p>After two semesters with a 4.0 average, I'm taking the Summer to tackle a few items that need some devoted attention--that, and I'm playing a few games, reading a bit more, and learning how to create shell commands for Unix.</p>
    <h2>Here's what I'm <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/172459774-chris-clevenger">reading now.</a></h2>
      <p>Right now, I'm in the middle of "Chain-Gang All-Stars" by Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah, and, man, is it one helluva book. Last year I did a bit of writing about the state of our prison systems. This book is about as honest and brutal a picture of our penal situation ass any I've ever encountered--and it's captivating. Every American should be reading this book.</p>
