    <h1>WHAT I'M DOING NOW</h1>
    <p class="small">Inspired by <a href="https://sive.rs/now">Derek Sivers</a> and others on <a href="https://nownownow.com/">nownownow.com</a>.</p>
    <p>Updated on December 4, 2023, from my home in Auburn, Alabama.</p>
    <h2>I'm still leading the <a href="https://www.lcdcalabama.org/">Lee County Democratic Club</a>.</h2>
      <p>We are taking the holiday season slowly with LCDC but are still remaining active. We'll ramp things up in the New Year. If you want to get involved, sign up <a href="https://www.lcdcalabama.org/">HERE</a>.</p>
    <h2>We just finished our busiest season at Jack Brown's Beer and Burger Joint in Auburn.</h2>
        <p>The end of football season--and the coming of winter--means slower days at the joint. Over the next several weeks, we'll be dialing in processes and getting things ready to roll for the start of Spring.</p>
        <p>Personally, I'll be using the next several months to dig a bit deeper with our staff. The past three months have been wide open. That means that it's been harder to dig deep and do one-on-one coaching with folks like I'd like to. We'll be reviewing performance and spending time on personal development top to bottom.</p>
    <h2>I was accepted at Troy University and have started prepping for classes that start next month.</h2>
      <p>It feels indulgent. Registering for school--particularly in the later part of my 30's--seemed daunting and strange. But, over the past year, I've found myself searching for ways to sneak in more time with books, thoughts, and ideas. Instead of trying to squeeze it in, I'd like to work towards a life where the things that matter most to me intellectually are the cornerstones of my life--the important things that I sort everything else around.</p>
      <p>Right now, I'll be knocking out elementary and foundational courses. The goal? Study literature and history.</p>
    <h2>Here's what I'm reading:</h2>
      <p>I just knocked out two books that I've been working through over the past couple of months--one by Karl Ove Knausgaard and "The Way of Kings" by Brandon Sanderson. Finishing the final installment in Knausgaard's "My Struggle" series was bittersweet. I've fallen in love with his writing. "The Way of Kings" was one of the best works of fiction I've read in a long time. I completely lost myself in it during the last 400 pages or so.</p>
      <p>Now, I've picked up Tolstoy's "Anna Karenina" and am listening to Patrick Stewart's new autobiography on my walks to work.</p>
