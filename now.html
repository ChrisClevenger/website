    <h1>WHAT I'M DOING NOW</h1>
    <p class="small">Inspired by <a href="https://sive.rs/now">Derek Sivers</a> and others on <a href="https://nownownow.com/">nownownow.com</a>.</p>
    <p>Updated on September 11, 2023 from my home in Auburn, Alabama.</p>
    <h2>I've been spending a good deal of time at Jack Brown's Beer and Burger Joint.</h2>
        <p>Since we've opened, I find myself in the joint at some point most everyday. Don't get me wrong, I still make sure to get my time away--and that's becoming more regular the longer we've been open.</p>
        <p>Auburn has been good to us so far. We had two killer weeks before students returned and have been enjoying the business that college football season brings in Auburn. If you find yourself in downtown Auburn for any reason, stop in for a drink. Chances are I'll be there.</p>
    <h2>The <a href="https://www.lcdcalabama.org/">Lee County Democratic Club</a> continues to receive a bit of my attention.</h2>
        <p>Most weeks, I'm still meeting with some of the folks from the LCDC or the Lee County Democratic Executive Committee. From a local perspective, the Democratic party in Lee County is making solid progress and promises to be a positive force for good in our communities here. We're always looking for volunteers.  If you're interested in jumping in, you can sign up <a href="https://www.lcdcalabama.org/get_involved">here</a>.</p>
    <h2>I'm finding more time to read and introspection.</h2>
    <p>For everything there is a season--and things come in waves. Over the past several months, the business of opening a bar in Auburn has kept me fairly preoccupied. I've been staying up later and sleeping a little more in the morning. My reading and writing have been the most recent casualties in a war that I find myself fighting in cycles.</p>
    <p>Finding time to read or write brings a reliable sense of joy and balance. Right now, I'm reading the sixth volume of Karl Ove Knausgaard's <i>My Struggle</i>, <i>The Way of Kings</i> by Brian Sanderson, and listening to <i>The Half Known Life: In Search of Paradise</i> by Pico Iver on my walks to work.</p>
