    <h1>WHAT I'M DOING NOW</h1>
      <p class="small">Inspired by <a href="https://sive.rs/now">Derek Sivers</a> and others on <a href="https://nownownow.com/">nownownow.com</a>.</p>
      <p>Updated on June 21, 2024, from my new home in Austin, Texas.</p>
    <h2>We've made the move to Austin!</h2>
      <p>Jess and I have long had the goal of making our way back to Austin. It's where we met and both have roots. Also, it's a place where both of us can get elbow deep in the things we love to do. I've had some of the best vegan/vegetarian food I've ever had over the past week--and we've needed it. Nothing takes it out of you more than moving all your belongings half way across the United States. We're slowly unpacking and setting up house but still have a lot to do. Just disregard all the uhaul boxes lined on the walls.</p>
    <h2>Book club is rolling right along! </h2>
      <p>We just wrapped up our reading of "Linchpin" by Seth Godin. If you're not creating art or building connections like you'd like, pick it up. If you want a more detailed summary, shoot me an email and I'll be happy to share my notes. Our next book (starting next Thursday) will be "Start with Why" by Simon Senek. Each week, members get access to the Zoom call, audio and video files, and a full transcript. </p>
      <p>If you want to join, shoot me an <a href="form">here</a>.</p>
    <h2>It's official. I start a new job next week.</h2>
      <p>Starting next week, I'll be working with <a href="https://restaurent.com/vendor/wiphospitality/">WIP Hospitality</a> at <a href="https://thepitchaustin.com/">The Pitch</a> here in Austin. We've got two bars, four food trucks, a coffee joint--not to mention pickleball and beach volleyball courts. It's gonna be wild.</p>
    <h2>I've been playing a lot of Skyrim.</h2>
      <p>It's been a nice escape from the stresses that go along with moving--and a way to nurse my book hangover (see below). I've also been reading/researching/playing a few text-based adventure games. Those have really caught my attention and spurred some creativity.</p>
    <h2>Here's what I'm <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/172459774-chris-clevenger">reading now.</a></h2>
      <p>"Stoner" by John Williams wrecked me. If I'm honest, I'm in a bit of a book hangover. I'm slowly working through a couple of other books but it'll be hard for anything to measure up. I'll get over it, but I'm not there yet. "Stoner" is one of the best pieces of literature I've ever read and has left me emotionally destroyed.</p>
