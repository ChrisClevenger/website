    <h1>WHAT I'M DOING NOW</h1>

    <h2>I am honored to serve as the President of the <a href="https://www.lcdcalabama.org/">Lee County Democratic Club</a>.</h2>
      <p>I was appointed President of LCDC at our meeting on September 23, 2023. I'm certainly honored to be filling the role and humbled to follow in the footsteps of Emily Jortner--an inspiring human being. Over the next few months we'll be initiating plans for the coming year to get Democrats in Lee County more involved, more visible, and more motivated. For now, I'm focusing on touching base with existing members and getting to know new ones. If you want to get involved, sign up <a href="https://www.lcdcalabama.org/">HERE</a>.</p>
    <h2>We are still slinging burgers and beer at Jack Brown's Beer and Burger Joint.</h2>
        <p>With game days come big crowds. It's been interesting to see the fluctuation of business between home and away games here in Auburn. Although, whatever the gameday schedule, we've stayed relatively busy late in the week.</p>
        <p>We've had recent personnel and management changes. With those come growing pains and new opportunities to coach and develop everyone involved. I've been leaning into those moments and cherishing the time I spend watching the joint grow. </p>
    <h2>I'm still reading and writing--sporadically.</h2>
      <p>On the mornings when I'm not exhausted from the night before, I manage to sneak an hour or two of quiet time in each morning. I've started putting words to paper again and am enjoying the process.</p>
      <p>Right now, I'm reading the sixth volume of Karl Ove Knausgaard's <i>My Struggle</i>, <i>The Way of Kings</i> by Brian Sanderson, and listening to <i>Unmasking Autism</i> by Devon Price, PhD, on my walks.</p>
