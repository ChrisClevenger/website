    <h1>WHAT I'M DOING NOW</h1>
    <p class="small">Inspired by <a href="https://sive.rs/now">Derek Sivers</a> and others on <a href="https://nownownow.com/">nownownow.com</a>.</p>
    <p>Updated on March 17, 2024, from my home in Auburn, Alabama.</p>
    <h2>After spending a year helping relaunch the Democratic Party in Lee County, I've stepped down as president of our democratic club.</h2>
      <p>I'm immensely proud of the progress that we've made over the past year and bolstered by my confidence in the local party's current leadership. I'll be focusing on some upcoming changes and projects but will continue to invest in causes I care about.

    <h2>I'm dialing in our processes and refining how we operate at Jack Brown's in Auburn.</h2>
        <p>We've seen a lot of changes over the past three months at Jack Brown's. That means, we've seen some people go and welcomed several new people to the team. During this slow season, I'm taking the time to document processes, invest in coaching and training future leaders, and refining how we operate so that it's as smooth as silk.</p>
    <h2>I'm on the cusp of my second term at Troy University--having completed my first with a 4.0 GPA.</h2>
      <p>It feels indulgent. Registering for school--particularly in the later part of my 30's--seemed daunting and strange. But, over the past year, I've found myself searching for ways to sneak in more time with books, thoughts, and ideas. Instead of trying to squeeze it in, I'd like to work towards a life where the things that matter most to me intellectually are the cornerstones of my life--the important things that I sort everything else around.</p>
      <p>Right now, I'll be knocking out elementary and foundational courses. The goal? Study literature and history.</p>
    <h2>Here's what I'm <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/172459774-chris-clevenger">reading now.</a></h2>
      <p>I've been working through books at a pretty steady pace this year. Along the way, I've run across several that I'd give only the highest praise for.</p>
      <p>I highly recommend--and thoroughly enjoyed--"The Will of the Many" by James Islington. If you're looking for something really unique, pick up "This is How You Lose the Time War" by El-Mohtar or "Between Two Fires" by Buehlman.</p>
