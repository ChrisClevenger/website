    <h1>WHAT I'M DOING NOW</h1>
    <p class="small">Inspired by <a href="https://sive.rs/now">Derek Sivers</a> and others on <a href="https://nownownow.com/">nownownow.com</a>.</p>
    <p>Updated on June 6, 2023 from my home in Auburn, Alabama.</p>
    <h2>I just completed the Foundations course from <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/home"> The Odin Project</a> and am moving on to Ruby on Rails.</h2>
        <p>I've spent the past month or so learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The course is open-source, free, and has a decent community built around it. So far, I've built <a href="https://chrisclevenger.github.io/project-landing-page/">landing pages,</a> a <a href="https://chrisclevenger.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/">rock-paper-scissors game,</a> an <a href="https://chrisclevenger.github.io/etch-a-sketch/">online Etch-A-Sketch,</a> and a <a href="https://chrisclevenger.github.io/calculator/">calculator.</a> It ain't much, but it's honest work.</p>
        <p>I'm excited about diving into some backend development. The full course could take up to 8-12 months--depending on my pace. I've got a few projects I'd like to build--but I need to learn some databases first, and I'm trying to be methodical about the process.</p>
        <p>Right now, I'm enjoying the process and the challenge that comes with troubleshooting my own mistakes.</p>
    <h2>The <a href="https://www.lcdcalabama.org/">Lee County Democratic Club</a> has been a bit more active over the last month.</h2>
        <p>I'm still meeting just about every Tuesday with the current president of LCDC. Last month we had the first monthly meeting in a while, and I was able to meet many of the members who've been involved for years. Several volunteered to help with Pride on the Plains, an event we attended over the weekend to celebrate Pride Month in the South. If you're interested in jumping in, you can sign up <a href="https://www.lcdcalabama.org/get_involved">here</a>.</p>
    <h2>We've got a date for Jack Brown's grand opening--July 24th!</h2>
        <p>Over the past month, the management team has been polished up. We've now got a core group of four--myself, a killer assistant general manager, and two solid fellows who will be running the back of house. Most of the initial training is complete, and we'll start hiring the rest of the team during the first couple of weeks of July. I'm looking forward to getting my hands dirty and getting back to regular, daily work with folks in the wild.</p>
    <h2>I've put the brakes on expanding copywriting clients on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-clevenger-573215167/">LinkedIn.</a></h2>
        <p>Don't get me wrong, I'm still writing. And I wouldn't turn down an opportunity to work on an important/exciting/interesting project. What was sucking the life out of me was generating content primarily for LinkedIn for the sole purpose of making more connections/getting more clients.</p>
        <p>That creative impulse has been coming out in my coding and development (see above). I've been gaining a lot of satisfaction from putting together a team in real life for Jack Brown's. Real connection is important to me--and I was struggling to find it on LinkedIn.</p>
