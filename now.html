    <h1>WHAT I'M DOING NOW</h1>
    <p class="small">Inspired by <a href="https://sive.rs/now">Derek Sivers</a> and others on <a href="https://nownownow.com/">nownownow.com</a>.</p>
    <p>Updated on May 6, 2023 from Auburn, Alabama.</p>
    <h2>I'm building this website from the ground up while learning HTML and CSS.</h2>
        <p>It may not seem like much, but I've decided to improve my website and teach myself some front-end dev in the process. After doing a few audits on my old site (hosted through Squarespace), I noticed that my homepage alone had 1,600 lines of code. I kept getting feedback from Semrush about the ratio of code-to-text on my posts--even when articles were 1,500 words or longer. Something had to change.</p>
        <p>So far, I've built the homepage with HTML and learned how to use CSS to format the navbar and future blog articles to be included. I'll be migrating everything <a href="blog">here</a>.</p>
        <p>This site won't ever be complex. And I like it that way. But it is a good way to learn front-end development and improve the health of my site for SEO.</p>
    <h2>I'm working with the <a href="https://www.lcdcalabama.org/">Lee County Democratic Club</a> and have been helping with Democratic efforts in Alabama.</h2>
        <p>Each week I'm meeting with local democratic organizers and trying to add a little fuel to local flames. Right now, it's a lot of planning and revitalizing--especially focused on our local chapter in Lee County.

    <h2>Jack Brown's Beer and Burger Joint will be opening in Auburn sometime in July.</h2>
        <p>Things have been slow go with construction the first part of this year. It's given me a lot of time to make the rounds to some of the other Jack Brown's joints and get some training under my belt. When we open in July, I'll be the General Manager for the joint in Auburn. It's hard to go wrong with beer and burgers, but I'm most excited about putting together a solid team and creating a memorable experience for folks that walk through the door.</p>
    <h2>I'm growing my content and copywriting business on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-clevenger-573215167/">LinkedIn</a>.</h2>
        <p>Copywriting--well, writing in general--is still a driving force in my life. I've had a few opportunities over the past six months to use some of those old muscles to help a couple of small businesses grow and expand. I'm going to keep doing more of the same--for my own business endeavors and for others.</p>
