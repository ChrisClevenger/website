    <h1>WHAT I'M DOING NOW</h1>
    <p class="small">Inspired by <a href="https://sive.rs/now">Derek Sivers</a> and others on <a href="https://nownownow.com/">nownownow.com</a>.</p>
    <p>Updated on October 5, 2023, from my home in Auburn, Alabama.</p>
    <h2>I am honored to serve as the President of the <a href="https://www.lcdcalabama.org/">Lee County Democratic Club</a>.</h2>
      <p>I was appointed President of LCDC at our meeting on September 23, 2023. I'm certainly honored to be filling the role and humbled to follow in the footsteps of Emily Jortner--an inspiring human being. Over the next few months we'll be initiating plans for the coming year to get Democrats in Lee County more involved, more visible, and more motivated. For now, I'm focusing on touching base with existing members and getting to know new ones. If you want to get involved, sign up <a href="https://www.lcdcalabama.org/">HERE</a>.</p>
    <h2>I've been spending a good deal of time at Jack Brown's Beer and Burger Joint.</h2>
        <p>Since we've opened, I find myself in the joint at some point most everyday. Don't get me wrong, I still make sure to get my time away--and that's becoming more regular the longer we've been open.</p>
        <p>Auburn has been good to us so far. We had two killer weeks before students returned and have been enjoying the business that college football season brings in Auburn. If you find yourself in downtown Auburn for any reason, stop in for a drink. Chances are I'll be there.</p>
    <h2>I'm finding more time to read and introspection.</h2>
      <p>For everything there is a season--and things come in waves. Over the past several months, the business of opening a bar in Auburn has kept me fairly preoccupied. I've been staying up later and sleeping a little more in the morning. My reading and writing have been the most recent casualties in a war that I find myself fighting in cycles.</p>
      <p>Finding time to read or write brings a reliable sense of joy and balance. Right now, I'm reading the sixth volume of Karl Ove Knausgaard's <i>My Struggle</i>, <i>The Way of Kings</i> by Brian Sanderson, and listening to <i>The Half Known Life: In Search of Paradise</i> by Pico Iver on my walks to work.</p>
