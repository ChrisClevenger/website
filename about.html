    <p>There's something to be said for the sense of continuity that comes with consciousness. The truth is, I'm becoming more and more comfortable with the passing of time--and more experience--leading towards more growth and expansion.</p>

    <h1>Filling in the Gaps:</h1>
      <p>There's a lot of life that can't be compressed to a timeline. There's people I've loved and lost, friends I've found, and experiences I've had that have deeply moved me and made me who I am. I've found faith, lost it, found it again, and constantly hover somewhere in between. The same with love.</p>
      <p>To try and distill my experience down to bulleted list is daunting--even if I realize it might be helpful for myself and those with whom I come in contact. That being the case, here are a few of the principles and themes that seem to run through my life:</p>
      <h2>I have a tendency to be introspective.</h2>
        <p>Give me a quiet room, some empty pages, and a few books and I'm generally happy. As a child I can remember sitting on the side of my bed in a quiet room and staring at the wall, letting my mind wander and explore--well, whatever. My own thoughts fascinate me and keep me pretty entertained. Sometimes noise and clamor can be overwhelming. I seek out quiet spaces where I can let my mind focus on what it would like. When it needs more information or input, I seek it out.</p>
      <h2>Creativity and exploration guide me.</h2>
        <p>I love problems--which is part of the reason some of my relationships (both professionally and romantically) have been overly challenging. I love to read and experiment. Figuring things out, making disparate systems work, or discovering a new way of being and existing in the world keeps me moving. Because of this, I read on a whim--whatever interests me at the moment is what I pick up. I try to be free with my interests and allow my passion to direct my path. I've been led to new areas, places, and careers. I've found that if I let creativity and interest lead me there, I'm more liable to do work I'm proud of.</p>
      <h2>I strive to be as egalitarian as possible.</h2>
        <p>That's a nice way to say that I have a problem with authority--because I do. Let me clarify: there's a difference between legitimate authority and--well--bullshit. There was a time in my life (see ministerial experience above) when I would have lauded the value of ultimate authority. I knew what it was. I had it. I used it. I benefited from it. And I was dead wrong--about so many things.</p>
        <p>The fact is I don't have anything figured out. I reserve the right to be wrong and to change my mind when I learn better. I've always bristled at any overt exercise of authority on another's part. Hierarchical organizations infuriate me. Even legitimate pedagogy is hard for me to swallow. Give me a flat, democratic organization and let's go.</p>
      <h2>I like to build things--organizations, companies, groups, and movements.</h2>
        <p>I'm a starter. Podcast networks, organizations, Bigfoot Church, companies, and--unironically--startups. I love getting things off the ground. And I love working with my hands. I always have. I like to jump in, figure things out, get things rolling, and then move onto the next challenge or obstacle. I like bringing ideas to life: thoughts to books, concepts to movements, drafts to construction. Being in a high-stress or high-stakes environment calms me. It's where I do some of my best work. </p>
      <h2>A sense of community is important to me.</h2>
        <p>Finding commonality and bringing folks together has always been a part of who I am. I started a life in ministry because of that sense of community; I left because it was more exclusive than I could stomach. Whatever industry or business I've found my way into has always been about people. Coffee shops are all about community. Bigfoot Church was about more than yoga in the park; it was about the people I met. I cherish my friendships and keep a handful of people close to my heart. A commitment to community is why I've gotten involved with local political efforts. And it's why I'll continue to invest in the people around me.</p>
      <h2>I'm learning to be good to myself.</h2>
        <p>There's so much shame and guilt that can be levied against just about anyone. The fact of the matter is that those tools--like so many--are ways that we try to impose control on the behavior of others. Not all guilt is escapable (some is even justifiable), but most of us have felt more than our fair share. My life may not look like someone else's. I may not make the same decisions as those around me. And I'm ok with that--and I'm learning to be more ok with it every day. Knowing who you are, what you like, how you want to live, and pursing those things that bring your meaning is deeply important. I'm trying to give myself more of that.</p>
